# AI Agents, digital coworkers
  
## Context

Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a **back-office accelerator**—it’s becoming a **front-line business enabler**. While AI has been part of our digital strategies for years, the evolution toward Agentic AI marks a transformative shift. This new generation of AI can not only understand and respond—it can **plan, act, and learn**.

To fully appreciate this evolution, this document take a step-by-step journey: starting with Large Language Models (LLMs), then moving into AI Workflows, and finally diving into Agentic AI. Each section includes a real-world example with a detailed walk-through of the process—from request to resolution—with human involvement clearly highlighted.

  

## 1: Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs, or Large Language Models, are  a type of artificial intelligence that uses deep learning techniques to **understand, generate, and manipulate** human language. They are trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform various natural language processing tasks like text generation, translation, and summarization.  Applications like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude are built on top LLMs.

Since they work on trained data, they don't have access to data outside of the trained data.
**Key Traits:**

-   **Stateless**: Responds to input but doesn't remember past interactions unless explicitly designed to.
    
-   **Reactive**: Waits for a prompt and then replies.
    
-   **Narrowly focused**: Excels in language-related tasks, like answering questions or generating content.

### Example: Virtual Mortgage Assistant:
A customer visits the bank’s website and asks: “How much can I borrow for a mortgage if I earn £45,000 a year?”

 1. **User Input**: The customer types the question into the mortgage chatbot interface.
2. **LLM Invocation**: The chatbot passes the question to an LLM, which identifies the intent (mortgage affordability) and key variables (income).
3. **Rule-Based Calculation**: The system queries affordability rules and calculates a general estimate based on internal policies (e.g., 4.5x salary).
4. **Response Generation**: The LLM responds with: “Based on your income, you may be eligible to borrow approximately £202,500. For a personalized quote, we’ll need more details like your expenses and deposit amount.”
5. **Output to User**: The answer is shown instantly in the chatbot window.
6. **Optional Escalation (Human Involved)**: If the customer asks about tax impacts, shared ownership schemes, or regulatory clauses, the chatbot may escalate to a mortgage advisor.

## 2: AI Workflows
AI Workflows are orchestrated systems where multiple AI and non-AI components work together to complete an end-to-end business process. These include LLMs, computer vision, ML models, APIs, and rules engines.

They follow pre-defined path set by human called control logic. RAG (Retrive Augmented Generation)  is an example of AI workflow that helps AI models look things up before providing an answer.

**Key Traits:**
-   **Process-driven**: Designed around a *predefined* sequence or flow of steps.
    
-   **Modular**: Different AI components are connected in a pipeline.
    
-   **Partial automation**: Human-in-the-loop is common, especially for edge cases or approvals.

### Example: End-to-End Mortgage Application Processing
A customer applies for a mortgage through the bank’s digital portal.

  

Step-by-Step Flow:

1. **Application Submission**: The customer submits income data, credit history consent, and uploads ID and payslips.
2. **Document Ingestion (AI/ML)**: OCR and NLP extract data from the documents (e.g., salary, employer, ID details).
3. **Credit Check (API Call + ML)**:An API request to credit bureaus retrieves the credit score and payment history.
4. **Affordability Assessment (Rules + ML)**:An internal engine calculates disposable income and matches against mortgage criteria.
5. **LLM Communication**:If the customer requests an explanation of mortgage types or term differences, the LLM generates simplified responses.
6. **Approval Decision** (Rules Engine): A decision engine recommends approval or rejection based on policy thresholds.
7. **Underwriter Review** (Human Involved): If the case is borderline or involves exceptions (e.g., unusual income sources), a human underwriter is flagged to review.
8. **Notification**: The decision and next steps are shared with the customer via email or portal.

## AI Agents

Agentic AI, or AI Agents, are autonomous systems that can plan, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike static models, agents operate in a loop: they perceive their environment, reason about their options, execute actions, and learn from feedback.

These systems can reason, plan, and act autonomously toward a defined goal. These agents loop through sensing, reasoning, acting, and learning—minimizing human intervention while adapting to real-world dynamics.

  
In Agentic AI, human (decision maker) is replaced by an agent. Where human human used to reason and act, the agent will do exactly that. Agents autonomously iterates until the best results are reached

**Key Traits:**

-   **Autonomous**: Can operate independently to achieve goals.
    
-   **Goal-oriented**: Works toward outcomes rather than single tasks.
    
-   **Continuous**: Maintains memory/state and updates strategies based on feedback.
    
-   **Reasoning and planning**: Makes decisions dynamically, not just following a predefined path.

### Example: Mortgage Portfolio Optimization Agent

An AI agent manages a bank’s active mortgage portfolio to ensure financial health, early risk detection, and operational efficiency.

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: The agent ingests data from loan servicing systems, payment feeds, and credit risk models.
2. **Risk Forecasting** (ML): Predictive models assess which borrowers may default based on behavioral changes or macroeconomic signals.
3. **Policy Matching** (Business Rules): The agent checks which accounts trigger risk thresholds or qualify for proactive intervention (e.g., offer payment holidays or restructuring).
4. **Planning** (Agentic Reasoning): The agent prioritizes cases and proposes actions (e.g., initiate outbound communication, flag for legal review, simulate portfolio impact).
5. **Execution** (Autonomous Action): Automatically drafts personalized emails using LLMs, schedules follow-ups, or adjusts internal ratings.
6. **Escalation Logic** (Human Involved): High-risk cases or regulatory-sensitive actions (e.g., foreclosure risk) are escalated to human risk officers for review.
7. **Learning Loop**: Based on customer responses and outcomes, the agent adjusts future prioritization logic and recommendations.

## Conclusion

Agentic AI isn’t just another tool in the box—it’s a rethinking of how digital systems operate.  As we integrate LLMs into workflows and evolve toward agentic systems, the role of AI in business moves from back-office efficiency to strategic differentiation.

Each layer—from LLMs to Agentic AI—represents a different level of maturity in intelligent automation. LLMs enhance **communication**. AI Workflows **automate** decisions. Agentic AI creates **adaptive, autonomous systems** that act as digital coworkers. Agentic AI is based on ReAct Framework (Reason and Act)

This layered intelligence enables businesses to:

 - Personalize customer experience at scale 
 - Reduce operational overhead
 - Respond to real-time market and regulatory changes 
 - Free up human talent for higher-value tasks
