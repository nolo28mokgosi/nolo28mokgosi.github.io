# Introduction

According to Microsoft, Azure Well-Architected Framework is "a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve quality of worklload".
This framework is a set of what we normally refer to as non-functionals in projects. Sometime referred to as software qualities, sometimes ilities.

Note: Just like Master Chef competition, ingredients available to the chef does not mean those ingridients must be used to in 1 meal.Framework provide guidance.

I'm in the process of understanding and learning the framework. I'll document and summarise some of the valuable nuggets in the process. My documentation does not replace microsoft documentation, I'll try and align some of the terms and qualities we learnt pre-Azure.

Well-Architected Framework (WAF) consists of 5 pillars of architectural excellence
1. Reliability
2. Security
3. Cost Optimization
4. Operational Excellence
5. Performance Efficiency

Whats interesting is the shift of focus on pillars like Cost Optimization, something that has been ignored in the past on software we deployed on-premises.

The next sections dives into details of each Pillar
