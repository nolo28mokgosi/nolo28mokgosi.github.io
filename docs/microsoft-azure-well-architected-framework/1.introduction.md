# Introduction

Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework is long to repeat in the document, I'll use the MAWAF accronyms instead.
According to Microsoft, it is "a set of guiding tenetants that can be used to improve quality of worklload".
This framework is a set of what we normally refer to as non-functionals in projects. Sometime referred to as software qualities, sometimes ilities.

It consists of 5 pillars of architectural excellence
1. Reliability
2. Security
3. Cost Optimization
4. Operational Excellence
5. Performance Efficiency
