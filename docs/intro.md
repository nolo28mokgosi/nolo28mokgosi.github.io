# Intro to Toolbox

Toolbox is a personal collection of notes I’ve built up while learning, experimenting, and working across software development, engineering, and architecture. It’s a place where I capture things I don’t want to forget — ideas that clicked, patterns I’ve noticed, and lessons picked up along the way. Some notes are practical and hands-on, others are more reflective, but together they help me think more clearly about systems and how I build them.
