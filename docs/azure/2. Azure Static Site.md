## Problem statement
I would like to host a static site on Azure.

## Solution
I have hosted a site on Azure Web App before. This time I wanted to try  Azure Static web. Thereâ€™s lots of material out there I chose to follow [Miscrosoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/get-started-portal?pivots=azure-devops&tabs=vanilla-javascript) with reference to [John's blog post]( https://blog.logrocket.com/azure-static-web-apps-netlify-alternative/) and other posts highlighted in the reference section.

I started of with creating a docusaurus site on my local machine. It's very easy & quick to create. Process documented [here.](https://docusaurus.io/docs)

I then commited my code on Azure Devops Repo.

According to [Miscrosoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/get-started-portal?pivots=azure-devops&tabs=vanilla-javascript), things suppose to be eazy but that's not the case. 

## Issues
2 issues that needs workaround 
### No Organisation Issue
Following [Miscrosoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/get-started-portal?pivots=azure-devops&tabs=vanilla-javascript), you should be able to select your subscription on the organisation dropdown but the functinality does not work.
Googling the issue looks like its [common](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/921909/azure-static-web-app-connection-with-devops-not-sh.html),  best way is to create custom build configuration as specified [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/build-configuration?tabs=azure-devops).
I got the build idea from [hendrik](https://hendrikbulens.com/2020/06/01/automically-deploy-a-static-website-to-azure-app-service-using-azure-devops/)

### Google Domain issue
According to [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/custom-domain?tabs=azure-dns#add-domain-using-txt-record-validation), google domains do not support domain records that affect how you configure your apex domain. Therefore we need to delegate our domain to azure. In summary we have to
- Create Azure DNS
- In google domain, setup custom name servers
- In Azure static app, add a custom domain
- Back to Azure DNS you need to add TXT and A or ALIAS record
All details well documented on [Manuel's blog](https://manueljavier.com/posts/setting_up_a_domain_name_for_an_azure_static_web_app/)
