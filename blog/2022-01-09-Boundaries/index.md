The term Domain Driven Design was coined by Eric Evans and it means [...]. It took me time to understand it and once I got it, I realised it is key & important to designing of software.

## Growing up
Boundaries are applied in our everyday life. You spot it by standards & principles that we apply, written & unwritten. For example, in our houses, there are things you do in 1 room, and not in another. Growing up I could have mu lunch in my bedroom when my mother is not around. Whenever she was around, world war 3.

I grew up in a 4  bedroom house, 2 bedrooms, kitchen & lounge. My recollection:
- **Bedroom 1:** My parents bedroom, always clean and organised. It was clear it was following my mother's standards and principles.
- **Bedroom 2:**A room i shared with my sister. Through constant screaming and ruling with terror, my mother tried to instill her standards and principles and failed dismallly. I implemented my standard & principles. I had soccer posters everywhere and Brazil 1998 squad was dominating. Zidane did hurt my feelings that year, I'll never forget.
- **Kitchen & Lounge:** Just like my parents bedroom, always organised. It was clear that my mother's standards and principles.

## In Tech

It is important to create and understand boundaries on the software we build. In m early development days, I used to focus on solving the problem for my stakeholders. I could solve everything in the software I was building. 
Stakeholder: Can you create a screen where i can manage client data
Me: Say no more
Stakeholder: I would like to send an email to client after completing this task
Me: I got it
Stake holder: Can you make sure that I can see all the holidays on the system
Me: Coming soon

Little did I know that it is eazy & possible to end up with a monolith that manage client data, holiday data, communications etc. It doesn't mean it's impossible, but in large organisation maintaining one pieace of software can be challenging and can introduce unessary cost & delay in introducing new functionality [..link to show disadvantages of monolith.]

Hence it is important to understand the capabilities & functions of the application you want to build.It is important to have a boundary of your application, with defined standards & principles.
Those standards & principles becomes a guidance to new joiners & anyone who would like to understand capabilities & functions of your application.

## Conclusion
Defining boundaries in large organisations can be a difficult task but a good investement for the future of software we build.
